# VbXlib

VvXlib is an X Windows System protocol client library for VB (.NET) as a *.netstandard2.0* assembly.

At this point it is more of a functional proof-of-concept; tons more needs to go into this before it is *production* ready.

If this is something you are interested in assisting with (pull requests, testing, documentation, etc.); I welcome the assistance!

## Additional Dependencies

- System.Drawing.Common (nuget)
