# VbXlib

VvXlib is an X Windows System protocol client library for VB (.NET) as a *.netstandard2.0* assembly.

At this point it is more of a functional proof-of-concept; tons more needs to go into this before it is *production* ready.

If this is something you are interested in assisting with (pull requests, testing, documentation, etc.); I welcome the assistance!

## Roadmap

I suppose the roadmap at this point is about determining the best way to continue to implement / transoform all the information contained in the [*Xlib - C Language X Interface* documentation](https://x.org/releases/current/doc/libX11/libX11/libX11.html) - as this is currently the resource I've been using to work through what has been done thus far.

## Additional Dependencies

- System.Drawing.Common (nuget)
